# Audiodrama database (better name pending)

WIP database of audiodramas I have listened to.

**Project Specifications**

Every audiodrama I have listened to will be in the database.

Each audiodrama has:
- name
- rating out of 10
- short review/description
- list of tags (musical, sci-fi, comedy, etc.)

Database is searchable by name and tags

There is a way to select multiple audiodramas, and a button that copies the description of all selected audiodramas to the clipboard.

There is an easy way for me to add audiodramas to the database.

There will be a number stating how many audiodramas are shown out of how many are in the database.
