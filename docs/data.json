All the characters, those three and the others, are very well written, particularly the villains. The Once and Future Nerd does an amazing job of having both comedy and a serious, real-worldrelevant, plot, which it balances very well. The podcast is split into chapter and books, with each chapter being 4 or 5 episodes, which gives it the feel of a classic fantasy novel. I'd recommend getting at least a little ways into the second chapter, as that is when the story picks up.",
