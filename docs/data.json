            "review": " is a sci-fi audiodrama about the crew of a smuggler ship travelling around the universe on the run from the evil human government, trying to solve the mystery of what happened to Starship Iris. It's similar to the TV show Firefly, and one of my all-time favorite audiodramas. It has a very good cast of (almost all queer) characters, which is one of its main strengths. It's also very funny at times, though the plot is serious.",

            "review": " is a sci-fi audiodrama centered on the crew of a space station all alone in deep space, searching for signals from extra-terrestrial life. It starts out like more of a sci-fi sitcom, but around episode 11, the plot becomes very good, so don't give up after the first few episodes. Wolf 359 is a well-liked, classic audiodrama, and I would recommend it to anyone new to the medium.",

However, it turns out that she is not totally alone, due to Bell, her scout-minder, whose job it is to talk to her every day from a nearby space station so she doesn't go insane. Second Star to the Left is an amazing story about two people and the relationship they form with each other.",

Thatâ€™s the first season, at least. If you like musicals and completely absurd plots along with some surprisingly good worldbuilding, this is the audiodrama for you. Some of the songs are really good, and the show keeps up it high quality through 3 seasons.",

Despite being a fan of musicals it didn't really resonate with me. I also prefer long-form stories over shorter ones regardless of medium, so this missed the mark on that front.",

They are set to play at hell's y2k concert in 2 weeks when their lead vocalist goes missing. The setting is similar to the book/tv show Good Omens, but with a focus on demons and late 90s goth culture. Brimstone Valley Mall is very funny, and the story is engaging. However, it ended the first season on a cliffhanger, and from what I've heard its not getting a second season.",
